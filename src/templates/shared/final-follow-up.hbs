Subject: {{firstName}} - Final Thoughts on {{companyName}}'s Marketing

Hi {{firstName}},

I wanted to reach out one last time about {{companyName}}'s digital marketing strategy.

I know you're busy running your business, and I don't want to be a pest. But I'd hate for you to miss out on an opportunity that could significantly impact your lead flow and bottom line.

**Quick Reminder of What Makes ServiceLine Different:**

**1. Pay-Per-Ranking SEO**
→ You only pay when we get you ranked on page 1
→ Not ranked for a keyword? You pay $0 for that keyword
→ Complete transparency: you see exactly what you're paying for

**2. Zero Google Ads Management Fees**  
→ We optimize your campaigns without taking a percentage cut
→ Save ${{estimatedAdManagementSavings | default "500-800"}}/month that currently goes to management fees
→ Your entire ad budget works for you, not us

**For {{companyName}} specifically:**
→ Projected cost: ${{projectedMonthlyCost}}/month (vs. ${{currentMonthlyCost}}/month currently)
→ Estimated savings: ${{monthlySavings}}/month
→ Expected lead increase: {{leadIncrease}}%
→ 90-day ranking guarantee

**Three Paths Forward:**

**Path 1: Let's Do This**
Reply "Yes" and I'll get {{companyName}} into our onboarding queue. We can start within 48 hours.

**Path 2: Not Right Now**
I totally understand. If timing isn't right, no problem. Would you like me to check back in {{followUpTiming | default "3 months"}}?

**Path 3: Need More Info**
Still have questions or concerns? Let's jump on a quick 10-minute call. I'm happy to clarify anything.

Just hit reply and let me know which path makes sense.

Either way, {{firstName}}, thanks for your time. I genuinely believe ServiceLine could transform {{companyName}}'s lead generation, but I respect whatever decision makes sense for your business.

Best,

P.S. - If you're not interested, no hard feelings. Just reply "Not interested" and I'll remove you from follow-ups. I appreciate you giving me the chance to present our approach.
