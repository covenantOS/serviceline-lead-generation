Subject: Great Chatting, {{firstName}} - {{companyName}} Proposal Attached

Hi {{firstName}},

Really enjoyed our conversation earlier today about {{companyName}}'s marketing strategy.

As promised, I've attached:

1. **Custom Ranking Strategy for {{companyName}}**
   - 15 target keywords for {{city}}
   - Current rankings vs. projected rankings
   - 6-month timeline to page 1 domination

2. **Cost Breakdown**
   - Pay-per-ranking pricing (what you'd pay at different ranking levels)
   - Comparison to your current marketing costs
   - Projected monthly savings

3. **Google Ads Optimization Plan**
   - Recommended campaign restructure
   - Wasted spend elimination
   - Conversion rate improvement tactics
   - All at $0 management cost

4. **ROI Projections**
   - Expected lead increase
   - Revenue impact based on your average job values
   - Break-even analysis

**Quick Recap of Key Points:**

✓ You're currently paying ${{currentMonthlyCost}}/month with limited results
✓ With ServiceLine's pay-per-ranking, you'd pay approximately ${{projectedMonthlyCost}}-${{projectedMonthlyCostHigh}}/month for actual page 1 rankings
✓ You'd save ${{adManagementSavings}}/month by eliminating Google Ads management fees
✓ Total projected savings: ${{totalMonthlySavings}}/month (${{totalAnnualSavings}}/year)
✓ We guarantee page 1 rankings for at least {{guaranteedKeywords}} keywords within 90 days, or you don't pay

**Next Steps:**
