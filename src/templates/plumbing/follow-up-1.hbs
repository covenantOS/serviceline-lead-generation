Subject: {{firstName}} - Checked Your Plumbing Rankings in {{city}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I reached out last week about ServiceLine's pay-per-ranking SEO model. I know you're busy running {{companyName}}, so I went ahead and did something that might interest you.

I analyzed where {{companyName}} currently ranks for the most valuable plumbing searches in {{city}}:

**Your Current Rankings:**
• "emergency plumber {{city}}" - Page {{emergencyRanking | default "3"}} ({{estimatedEmergencySearches | default "850"}} monthly searches)
• "water heater repair {{city}}" - Page {{waterHeaterRanking | default "4"}} ({{estimatedWaterHeaterSearches | default "620"}} monthly searches)
• "drain cleaning {{city}}" - Page {{drainRanking | default "2"}} ({{estimatedDrainSearches | default "440"}} monthly searches)

**What This Means:**
You're missing out on approximately {{estimatedMonthlyCalls | default "40-60"}} potential service calls per month that are going to competitors on page 1.

For plumbing jobs averaging ${{avgJobValue | default "450-1,200"}}, that's substantial lost revenue.

**Here's What We'd Do:**

**Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Emergency Call Domination**
• Optimize for high-intent keywords: "burst pipe," "water leak," "clogged toilet"
• Fix technical SEO issues (I found {{technicalIssues | default "23"}} on {{companyName}}'s site)
• Create emergency service landing pages that convert
• Restructure Google Ads for maximum emergency call capture

**Phase 2 (Month 3-4): Broader Service Rankings**
• Target installation and replacement keywords (higher ticket)
• Build local citations and Google Business Profile optimization
• Implement review generation system (you have {{reviewCount | default "only 12"}} Google reviews)

**Your Investment Under Pay-Per-Ranking:**

Let's say we get you ranked for 10 keywords (typical for plumbing companies):
• 3 keywords ranked #1-3: $150 each = $450
• 5 keywords ranked #4-7: $100 each = $500
• 2 keywords ranked #8-10: $50 each = $100

**Total: $1,050/month** (only paying for actual page 1 rankings)

Compare that to:
• Traditional SEO agency: $1,500-$2,500/month (no ranking guarantees)
• Google Ads management: $300-$500/month in fees

**With ServiceLine:**
→ Pay-per-ranking SEO: $1,050/month
→ Google Ads management: $0/month
→ Total: $1,050/month for both services
→ You save: $750-$1,950/month
