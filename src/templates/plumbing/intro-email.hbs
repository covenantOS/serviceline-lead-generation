Subject: {{companyName}} - Only Pay for SEO When You Actually Rank

Hi {{firstName}},

I was researching plumbing companies in {{city}} and came across {{companyName}}. Quick question:

Are you currently paying a monthly SEO fee regardless of whether you're actually ranking on page 1?

Most plumbing companies I talk to are frustrated because:
→ They pay $1,200-$2,000/month for SEO services
→ They're still on page 2 or 3 for "emergency plumber {{city}}"
→ Their Google Ads agency takes 15-20% off the top in management fees
→ Meanwhile, competitors are getting all the emergency calls at 10 PM on Saturday night

There's a better way.

**ServiceLine's Pay-Per-Ranking Model:**

You only pay when we actually get {{companyName}} ranked on page 1 of Google. Not ranked? You don't pay for that keyword. It's that simple.

**Plus**: We manage your Google Ads with **zero management fees**. No percentage cuts. No hidden charges. We optimize your ad spend, and you keep 100% of your budget working for you.

**Why Plumbing Companies Love This:**

• **Emergency call capture** - When someone searches "burst pipe repair near me" at 2 AM, you show up first
• **Transparent pricing** - You see exactly which keywords you're ranked for and what you pay
• **Seasonal flexibility** - Slow winter months? Lower rankings = lower costs
• **No wasted ad spend** - Every dollar goes to reaching customers, not agency fees

One plumbing company we work with in {{exampleCity | default "Denver"}} was paying $1,900/month for SEO with zero first-page rankings. After switching to ServiceLine:

✓ Ranked #1-3 for "emergency plumber Denver" in 3 months
✓ Now pays $1,100/month (only for actual rankings)
✓ Saves $350/month on eliminated Google Ads management fees  
✓ Emergency calls increased 180%
✓ Total marketing savings: $1,150/month

{{firstName}}, I'd love to show you:
→ Where {{companyName}} currently ranks for high-value plumbing keywords
→ Which keywords you should own in {{city}}
→ Exactly what you'd pay under pay-per-ranking (probably 30-40% less than now)
→ How we'd optimize your Google Ads at zero cost to you

P.S. - We guarantee first-page rankings for at least 5 keywords within 90 days, or you don't pay. No plumbing marketing company in {{city}} offers that.
