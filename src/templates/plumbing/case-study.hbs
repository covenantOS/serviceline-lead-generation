Subject: How a {{city}} Plumber Went From Page 3 to #1 (and Cut Costs 40%)

Hi {{firstName}},

Thought you'd appreciate this real-world example.

**Client:** Rapid Response Plumbing ({{caseStudyCity | default "Seattle, WA"}})
**Company Profile:** 5 plumbers, 4 service vans, 18 years in business

**Their Problem:**

James (the owner) was spending $2,200/month on digital marketing:
• $1,600/month to an SEO agency → Stuck on pages 2-4 for 14 months
• $600/month (15% fee) to a Google Ads agency managing his $4,000 ad budget
• Zero visibility for emergency plumbing calls
• Competitors dominating local search results

James told me: *"I felt like I was throwing money into a black hole. I couldn't tell you what I was paying for or if it was working. I was one month away from canceling everything."*

**What We Changed:**

**Week 1-2: Discovery & Setup**
• Comprehensive site audit revealed 31 SEO issues
• Identified that competitors were outranking him for "emergency" keywords
• Found his Google Ads were targeting 89 keywords (way too broad)
• Set up pay-per-ranking tracking for 18 high-value plumbing terms

**Month 1-3: Foundation Building**
• Fixed critical technical SEO errors
• Optimized Google Business Profile (was missing key info)
• Created emergency service landing pages
• Rebuilt Google Ads campaigns: narrowed to 23 high-converting keywords
• Cost to James: $0 for first 60 days (no rankings yet = no charges)

**Month 4: Breakthrough**
• First page rankings achieved for 7 keywords
• James's first invoice: $680 (only paid for those 7 rankings)
• Google Ads conversion rate jumped from 3.1% to 9.8%
• Saved $600 on eliminated ads management fee

**Month 6: Full Results**
• Ranked on page 1 for 14 different plumbing keywords
• #1 position for "emergency plumber Seattle" (1,200 monthly searches)
• #2 for "water heater repair Seattle"
• #3 for "burst pipe repair near me"

**The Numbers:**

**Before ServiceLine:**
• Monthly cost: $2,200 ($1,600 SEO + $600 ads management)
• Page 1 rankings: 0
• Monthly service calls: 38
• Emergency calls: 8-10/month
• Cost per lead: $158

**After 6 Months with ServiceLine:**
• Monthly cost: $1,320 (pay-per-ranking for 14 keywords)
• Page 1 rankings: 14
• Monthly service calls: 97
• Emergency calls: 31-35/month
• Cost per lead: $51
• Monthly savings: $880
• Annual savings: $10,560

**James's Favorite Part:**

*"The emergency calls changed everything. Before, we'd get maybe 2-3 calls per week for burst pipes or sewage backups - the high-ticket emergencies. Now we get 1-2 per day. And I love that I can see exactly what I'm paying for. If we drop from #1 to #6 for a keyword, I pay less. If we're not ranked at all, I pay nothing. It's the fairest marketing model I've ever seen."*

**Why This Model Works for Plumbers:**

1. **Emergency calls are everything** - One burst pipe call at $2,500 pays for your entire month of SEO

2. **Seasonal flexibility** - Rankings (and costs) can flex with your slow/busy seasons

3. **No wasted ad spend** - Without the 15% management fee, James keeps an extra $7,200/year

4. **Accountability** - You see exactly which keywords you rank for and what you're paying

**What Would This Look Like for {{companyName}}?**

Based on {{city}}'s search volume and competition, I estimate:
• We'd target 12-16 high-value keywords
• Achieve page 1 rankings for 8-12 within 90-120 days
• Your monthly cost: $900-$1,400 (for actual rankings only)
• Projected increase in calls: 60-120% within 6 months
• Savings vs. traditional agency: $600-$1,200/month
