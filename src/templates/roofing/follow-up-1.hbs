Subject: Re: {{companyName}} - Your Roofing SEO Analysis ({{city}})

Hi {{firstName}},

I reached out last week about ServiceLine's pay-per-ranking model. I know storm season keeps you busy, so I did something you might find valuable.

I analyzed where {{companyName}} ranks for the highest-value roofing searches in {{city}}:

**Your Current Rankings:**
• "roof replacement {{city}}" - Page {{replacementRanking | default "3"}} ({{estimatedReplacementSearches | default "720"}} monthly searches)
• "storm damage roof repair {{city}}" - Page {{stormRanking | default "4"}} ({{estimatedStormSearches | default "890"}} monthly searches)
• "insurance roof claims {{city}}" - Not ranked ({{estimatedInsuranceSearches | default "340"}} monthly searches)
• "metal roofing {{city}}" - Page {{metalRanking | default "5"}} ({{estimatedMetalSearches | default "280"}} monthly searches)

**What This Means:**

Homeowners and insurance adjusters searching for roofing services in {{city}} aren't finding {{companyName}} on page 1. You're likely missing {{estimatedMonthlyCalls | default "35-50"}} qualified leads per month.

At an average roofing job value of ${{avgJobValue | default "8,500-15,000"}}, that's significant lost revenue - especially during storm season when search volume explodes.

**Here's Your Opportunity:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Storm Damage Dominance**
• Target emergency keywords: "storm damage," "roof leak," "missing shingles"
• Optimize for insurance-related searches (higher ticket jobs)
• Fix technical issues (found {{technicalIssues | default "18"}} on your site)
• Create dedicated landing pages for insurance claims

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Replacement & Installation**
• Rank for high-value keywords: "roof replacement," "new roof installation"
• Target premium materials: "metal roofing," "architectural shingles"
• Build case studies and before/after galleries (great for conversions)
• Optimize Google Business Profile with storm damage photos

**Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Market Domination**
• Rank for commercial roofing terms
• Capture multi-property management searches
• Seasonal content optimization for storm seasons

**Your Investment with Pay-Per-Ranking:**

Projected rankings after 6 months (typical for roofing companies):
• 4 keywords ranked #1-3: $150 each = $600
• 6 keywords ranked #4-7: $100 each = $600  
• 3 keywords ranked #8-10: $50 each = $150

**Total: $1,350/month** (only for actual page 1 rankings)

**Compare to Traditional Model:**
• SEO agency: $2,000-$3,500/month (pay whether ranked or not)
• Google Ads management: ${{estimatedAdManagementFee | default "650"}}/month (15-20% of your ad spend)
• Total traditional cost: $2,650-$4,150/month

**With ServiceLine:**
→ Pay-per-ranking SEO: $1,350/month
→ Google Ads optimization: $0/month  
→ Total: $1,350/month for both services
→ Your savings: $1,300-$2,800/month

**Google Ads Optimization (At Zero Cost):**

We'd also restructure your Google Ads to:
• Target insurance claim searches specifically
• Geo-target neighborhoods with older roofs
• Adjust bids during storm events (when intent is highest)
• Eliminate wasted spend on low-intent keywords
• Improve Quality Scores to reduce cost-per-click

All without taking a penny in management fees. The ${{estimatedAdManagementFee}}/month you currently pay stays in your pocket.

{{firstName}}, I want to show you exactly what this looks like for {{companyName}}.

I'll build a custom 6-month ranking roadmap showing:
1. Which keywords we'd target and when
2. Your projected costs as rankings improve
3. Expected increase in qualified leads
4. ROI calculations based on your average job values
5. Google Ads optimization plan

Does {{availableTime1}} or {{availableTime2}} work for a 20-minute call?

Best,

P.S. - Storm season is {{stormSeasonTiming | default "approaching"}}. Let's get {{companyName}} ranked before searches spike and competition intensifies.
