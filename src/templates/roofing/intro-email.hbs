Subject: {{companyName}} - Stop Paying for SEO That Doesn't Get You Roofing Leads

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{companyName}} while researching roofing contractors in {{city}}. Let me ask you something:

When homeowners search "roof repair near me" or "roof replacement {{city}}" after a storm, are they finding you or your competitors?

Most roofing companies I speak with have the same frustrations:
→ Paying $1,500-$3,000/month for SEO with no page 1 rankings
→ Google Ads agency taking 15-20% in management fees ($500-$800/month)
→ Leads going to competitors who show up first
→ Can't track which marketing is actually generating jobs
→ Revenue drops during slow periods, but marketing costs stay the same

Here's what makes ServiceLine different:

**Pay-Per-Ranking SEO:**
You only pay when we get {{companyName}} ranked on page 1 of Google. No rankings = no charges for that keyword. Simple as that.

**$0 Google Ads Management:**
We optimize your ad campaigns, improve your quality scores, and lower your cost-per-click - without taking a single dollar in management fees.

**Why Roofing Companies Switch to ServiceLine:**

• **Storm season ready** - When storms hit and search volume spikes 400%, you're already ranked and capturing leads
• **Transparent pricing** - Pay $50-$150/month per keyword only when ranked on page 1
• **Seasonal flexibility** - Lower rankings in slow months = lower costs
• **Keep your ad budget** - Save $500-$1,000/month by eliminating management fees
• **High-ticket lead focus** - We target insurance claims and replacement jobs, not just repairs

**Real Example:**

A roofing company in {{exampleCity | default "Fort Worth"}} was paying $2,400/month for SEO and ads management with minimal results. After switching to ServiceLine:

✓ Ranked #1-3 for "roof replacement Fort Worth" in 4 months
✓ Now pays $1,250/month (only for actual rankings)
✓ Saves $600/month on eliminated Google Ads fees
✓ Insurance claim leads increased 265%
✓ Total monthly savings: $1,750 while getting better results

Their owner said: *"Finally, marketing that makes sense. I see my rankings every week, and I only pay for results. The money I save on ads management covers half my SEO costs."*

{{firstName}}, I'd like to show you:
→ Where {{companyName}} currently ranks for valuable roofing keywords
→ What you'd pay under our pay-per-ranking model (likely 30-50% less)
→ How we'd optimize your Google Ads without taking management fees
→ A 90-day roadmap to dominating roofing searches in {{city}}
