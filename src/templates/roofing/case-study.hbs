Subject: Case Study: How This Roofing Company Got 186% More Insurance Leads

Hi {{firstName}},

I want to share a success story that's particularly relevant for roofing contractors.

**Client:** Summit Roofing Solutions ({{caseStudyCity | default "Oklahoma City, OK"}})
**Profile:** 12 crews, residential and commercial roofing, 22 years in business
**Challenge:** Drowning in marketing costs, not enough high-quality leads

**Their Frustration:**

Tom (the owner) was spending $3,200/month on digital marketing:
• $2,400/month to an SEO agency → Stuck on pages 2-3 for 9 months
• $800/month (15%) to manage his $5,300 Google Ads budget
• Barely any insurance claim leads (the high-ticket jobs)
• Getting outbid on Google Ads by companies with bigger budgets
• Emergency storm calls going to competitors

Tom told me: *"After every storm, I'd see search volume spike on Google Trends, but we weren't capturing those leads. Homeowners were finding other roofers first. I was paying a fortune for marketing that wasn't working when I needed it most."*

**What We Did:**

**Week 1-2: Competitive Analysis**
• Discovered Tom's site had 28 SEO issues preventing rankings
• Found competitors dominating "insurance" and "storm damage" keywords
• Identified that 67% of his Google Ads budget was wasted on low-intent searches
• Set up pay-per-ranking tracking for 20 roofing keywords

**Month 1-2: Foundation**
• Fixed technical SEO problems (slow site speed, broken mobile design)
• Created dedicated landing pages for:
  - Insurance claims assistance
  - Storm damage assessment
  - Emergency roof repairs
  - Roof replacement 
• Optimized Google Business Profile with storm damage photos
• Rebuilt Google Ads campaigns around high-intent keywords
• Tom's cost: $0 (no rankings yet under pay-per-ranking model)

**Month 3-4: Rankings Begin**
• Achieved page 1 rankings for 8 keywords
• Tom's first invoice: $850 (only paid for those 8 rankings)
• Google Ads conversion rate improved from 2.8% to 11.3%
• First insurance claim lead came through organic search

**Month 5-7: Storm Season Hits**
• Major hailstorm in Oklahoma City
• Search volume for "roof damage" spiked 520%
• Summit Roofing ranked #1 for "storm damage roof repair OKC"
• Also ranked #2 for "insurance roof claims Oklahoma City"
• Phone exploded with calls

**Month 8-12: Sustained Success**
• Maintained rankings for 16 keywords through off-season
• Costs naturally decreased during slow months (paying for fewer top rankings)
• Re-optimized for next storm season

**The Complete Results:**

**Before ServiceLine:**
• Monthly cost: $3,200 ($2,400 SEO + $800 ads management)
• Page 1 rankings: 0
• Monthly leads: 31 (mix of low and high value)
• Insurance claim leads: 3-4/month
• Average cost per lead: $192
• Annual marketing spend: $38,400

**After 12 Months with ServiceLine:**
• Average monthly cost: $1,580 (pay-per-ranking, flexes seasonally)
• Page 1 rankings: 16
• Monthly leads: 89
• Insurance claim leads: 11-14/month
• Average cost per lead: $67
• Annual marketing spend: $18,960
• Annual savings: $19,440

**The Game-Changer: Insurance Leads**

Before: 3-4 insurance claim leads/month → After: 11-14 leads/month
→ That's 186% increase in the highest-value roofing jobs
→ Average insurance job: $14,500 vs. average repair: $2,800

**Tom's Testimonial:**

*"The pay-per-ranking model is brilliant for roofing companies. During storm season, I'm ranked high and getting tons of calls - and yes, I pay more. But I'm also bringing in $400K-$500K in insurance jobs. During slow months in winter, my rankings drop a bit and my costs go down too. It's the first time my marketing costs have actually aligned with my revenue fluctuations."*

*"And the Google Ads optimization with no management fees? That's $9,600 per year I'm saving. That covers half my entire SEO costs right there. It's a no-brainer."*

**Why This Works for Roofing Companies:**

1. **Storm season readiness** - You're already ranked when weather hits and searches spike

2. **Insurance lead optimization** - We target searches that indicate insurance claims (higher value)

3. **Seasonal cost flexibility** - Pay more when busy, pay less when slow

4. **Emergency call capture** - Rank for "emergency," "leak," "storm damage" terms

5. **No wasted ad budget** - Keep 100% of your Google Ads spend working for you

**What Would This Look Like for {{companyName}}?**

Based on {{city}}'s search volume, competition, and storm patterns:
• Target 14-18 high-value roofing keywords
• Achieve page 1 rankings for 10-14 within 90-120 days
• Your monthly cost: $1,200-$1,800 (only for actual rankings)
• Projected lead increase: 80-150% within 6 months
• Focus on insurance claims and replacement jobs
• Savings vs. traditional agency: $1,000-$2,000/month
