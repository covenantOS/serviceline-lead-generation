Subject: {{companyName}} - Stop Paying for SEO That Doesn't Deliver Results

Hi {{firstName}},

I came across {{companyName}} while researching HVAC companies in {{city}}, and I noticed something that's costing you customers every day.

When homeowners in {{city}} search for "emergency AC repair" or "HVAC installation near me," they're finding your competitors first. And I'm guessing you're already paying an agency $1,000-$2,500/month for SEO with little to show for it.

Here's the truth most HVAC companies face:
→ You pay monthly SEO fees whether you rank or not
→ Your Google Ads eat up 15-20% in management fees on top of ad spend
→ You're not sure if any of it is actually working

What if you only paid for SEO when you actually rank on page 1?

That's exactly how ServiceLine works. We're the only marketing company that charges **pay-per-ranking SEO** - meaning you only pay when we get you ranked for high-value HVAC keywords in {{city}}.

Plus, we manage your Google Ads with **$0 management fees**. That's right - no 15% cuts, no hidden charges. We optimize your ad spend without taking a penny in management fees.

**Why HVAC companies switch to ServiceLine:**

• Save $500-$1,000/month on SEO fees (only pay when ranked)
• Keep 15-20% more of your Google Ads budget
• Get 3-5x more qualified calls within 90 days
• Work with a team that understands HVAC seasonality and emergency calls

One of our clients, {{exampleCompany | default "a mid-sized HVAC company in Phoenix"}}, was spending $2,200/month on SEO with zero page-1 rankings. After switching to ServiceLine:

✓ Ranked #1-3 for "AC repair Phoenix" within 4 months
✓ Cut marketing costs by 40% (only paying for 8 rankings)
✓ Increased service calls by 230% during peak season
✓ They now pay us $960/month vs. $2,200 - and get actual results
