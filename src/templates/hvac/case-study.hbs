Subject: How This {{city}} HVAC Company Cut Marketing Costs 47% and Doubled Leads

Hi {{firstName}},

I wanted to share a success story that might resonate with you.

**Client:** Premium Comfort HVAC ({{caseStudyCity | default "Austin, TX"}})
**Size:** 8 technicians, 3 trucks
**Challenge:** Spending $2,800/month on SEO and Google Ads with declining results

**Their Frustrations (Sound Familiar?):**
→ Paying SEO agency $1,800/month but stuck on page 2-3
→ Google Ads agency taking 15% ($450/month) in management fees
→ Emergency AC calls going to competitors during peak season
→ Couldn't track which marketing was actually working
→ Ready to give up on digital marketing entirely

**What We Did:**

**Month 1-2: Foundation**
• Audited their existing SEO (found 47 technical issues)
• Rebuilt Google Ads campaigns with laser-focused local targeting
• Created dedicated landing pages for emergency services
• Set up pay-per-ranking tracking for 15 high-value keywords

**Month 3-4: Rankings Start Climbing**
• Achieved page 1 rankings for 6 keywords
• They paid us $720 (only for those 6 rankings)
• Google Ads conversion rate improved from 2.3% to 8.1%
• Saved $450/month on ads management fees

**Month 5-6: Breakthrough Results**
• Ranked #1-5 for 12 different HVAC keywords
• Monthly SEO cost: $1,350 (only paying for rankings)
• Service calls up 215% compared to previous year
• Cost per lead dropped from $180 to $62

**The Numbers:**

**Before ServiceLine:**
• Monthly cost: $2,800
• Page 1 rankings: 0
• Monthly service calls: 23
• Cost per lead: $180

**After ServiceLine (Month 6):**
• Monthly cost: $1,350 (pay-per-ranking SEO only)
• Page 1 rankings: 12
• Monthly service calls: 71
• Cost per lead: $62
• Savings: $1,450/month ($17,400/year)

**Their Favorite Part:**
Owner Mike said: *"I finally know exactly what I'm paying for. I see my rankings dashboard every week, and I only pay for results. The Google Ads optimization with no management fees is just icing on the cake. I'm keeping an extra $450/month that used to go to my old agency."*

**Why This Works for HVAC:**

1. **Pay-per-ranking aligns with seasonality** - During slower months, if rankings drop, you pay less. During peak season when competition is fierce, we fight harder to keep you ranked.

2. **$0 Google Ads management** - We know HVAC margins are tight. Every dollar of your ad budget should go to reaching customers, not agency fees.

3. **Emergency call optimization** - We understand that "emergency AC repair" searches at 2 AM are worth 10x more than general "HVAC services" searches.

{{firstName}}, I believe {{companyName}} has similar opportunities. 

**Here's what I'd like to do:**

Give me 20 minutes this week, and I'll show you:
✓ A side-by-side comparison: current costs vs. ServiceLine pay-per-ranking
✓ The exact keywords we'd target for {{companyName}} in {{city}}
✓ Projected rankings timeline (we're usually page 1 within 90-120 days)
✓ Your potential monthly cost (spoiler: likely 30-50% less than current)

No pressure, no commitment. Just transparency about what's possible.

Reply with your best day/time this week, and I'll send a calendar invite.
