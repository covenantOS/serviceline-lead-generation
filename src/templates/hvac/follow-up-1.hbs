Subject: Re: {{companyName}} - Your HVAC SEO Analysis is Ready

Hi {{firstName}},

I reached out last week about helping {{companyName}} rank higher without the typical monthly SEO fees.

I went ahead and ran a quick competitive analysis for HVAC companies in {{city}}, and I found something interesting about {{companyName}}:

**Current Situation:**
• You're ranking on page 3-4 for "{{topKeyword1}}" (92% of clicks go to page 1)
• Your competitors are capturing {{estimatedMonthlySearches}} monthly searches you're missing
• Based on your current ad spend, you're likely paying ${{estimatedAdManagementFee}}/month in Google Ads management fees

**Opportunity:**
If {{companyName}} ranked #1-5 for just these 3 keywords:
→ "{{topKeyword1}}"
→ "{{topKeyword2}}"
→ "{{topKeyword3}}"

You'd likely see 15-25 additional service calls per month. At an average HVAC job value of $3,500-$8,000, that's significant revenue.

**The ServiceLine Difference:**

Unlike traditional agencies, you'd only pay for the rankings we deliver:
• Rank #1-3: $150/month per keyword
• Rank #4-7: $100/month per keyword  
• Rank #8-10: $50/month per keyword
• Not ranked? You pay $0 for that keyword

PLUS - We manage your Google Ads for **free**. No 15% management fees. We optimize your campaigns, adjust bidding, write better ad copy, and you keep every dollar of your budget.

**Quick Math:**
If we get you ranked for 8 keywords (average for HVAC companies we work with):
→ You'd pay approximately $800-$1,200/month for SEO
→ You'd save ${{estimatedAdManagementFee}}/month on ads management
→ Traditional agency cost: $2,000-$3,500/month
→ Your savings: $800-$2,300/month while getting better results

{{firstName}}, I have 2 time slots this week to walk you through:
1. Your specific ranking opportunities in {{city}}
2. A side-by-side cost comparison 
3. Case studies from {{competitorExample | default "similar HVAC companies"}}

**Available times:**
→ {{availableTime1}}
→ {{availableTime2}}

Which works better for you?

P.S. - Summer is coming. Let's get {{companyName}} ranked before AC season hits and search volume spikes 300%.
